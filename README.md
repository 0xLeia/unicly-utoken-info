# Unicly uToken Info

## Overview

By adding your uToken info on this repository, your uToken dashboard page will show your uToken's custom logo and appraisal link.

#### What is an appraisal?

A uToken collection appraisal is a PDF report (by a third party auditor) that estimates the value of the collection.

## How to add token

**Adding a uToken checklist**:
- [ ] Fork the Github repository
- [ ] Create folder with name of token smartcontact address in lowercase `uTokens/<token_smartcontract_address>/`.
- [ ] Tell your designer that token image must be in SVG format, with max file size of 100kB.
- [ ] Upload your logo with file named `logo.svg` to previously created folder with smartcontract address, and if you done all correctly your path should look like this. `uTokens/0x3d9233f15bb93c78a4f07b5c5f7a018630217cb3/logo.svg`
- [ ] Upload your appraisal with file named `appraisal.pdf` to previously created folder with smartcontract address, and if you done all correctly your path should look like this. `uTokens/0x3d9233f15bb93c78a4f07b5c5f7a018630217cb3/appraisal.pdf`
- [ ] Upload your metadata, including description and social media links. The file should be named `info.json`, and the path should look like this: `uTokens/0x3d9233f15bb93c78a4f07b5c5f7a018630217cb3/info.json`. Here is an example of a correctly formatted info.json:
